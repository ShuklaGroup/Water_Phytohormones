## Description
Folders named after a simulated system (e.g., `AHK4_ZEA`) contain analysis scripts used to build the corresponding Markov State Model (MSM) of that receptor-hormone system. Notice that although the content of different folders is similar there may be small differences in the files. 

`Hydration landscapes` contains the code used to generate the hydration free energy landscapes.

`Hydration site analysis` contains the code used to generate the figures associated with hydration site analysis results.

## Data Files
Data files can be accessed on our shared [Box folder](https://uofi.box.com/s/qdnxe4pnugiz6i4kj5c4tpeeu1s7knkw).
